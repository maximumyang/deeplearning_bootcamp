TODO 3-1: The BaseCommand class has a show_usage method implemented, but the execute method is not 
implemented and is passed on to the child class. Think about why this difference is made.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):

Each class that inherits from BaseCommand may have a different implementaion.
Leaving the execute method to be implemented by the child classes allows for flexibility and customization, 
as different commands may have unique requirements for how they perform their tasks.


TODO 3-2: The update_current_path method of the BaseCommand class is slightly different from other methods. 
It has a @classmethod decorator and takes a cls argument instead of self. In Python, this is called a 
class method, and think about why it was implemented as a class method instead of a normal method.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
Decoratted with @classmethod show that it's class method rather
than an instance method. CLass methods are used when you want to operate on the
class itself rather than on instances of the class. 
i.e. update_current_path is used to update the 'current_path' attribute for the
entire class, not just for a specific instance.
